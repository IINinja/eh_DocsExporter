# eh_DocsExporter

Godot Plugin to export documentation directly from comments in your code to Github Wikis and/or Hugo sites.

It's partly based on GDQuest's docs maker, but works entirely inside Godot, and tries to follow godot's official docs styling for exported pages.

For instructions on hot to install and use it, or examples of exported Code Reference, checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/eh-jogos/eh_DocsExporter/wiki) or the [docs site](https://eh-jogos.github.io/eh_DocsExporter/)!
