Docs Exporter is a Godot plugin compatible with Godot 3.2.x aimed at building and exporting documentation directly from your code to a GitHub wiki and/or a Hugo site.

It is inspired by and partly based on [GDQuest\'s docs maker](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker) but works entirely inside Godot, and tries to follow Godot's official docs styling for exported pages.

The "Reference" section of this wiki was generated and exported using this plugin. To see an example of the GitHUb wiki export you can go to the [github wiki of the project repository](https://github.com/eh-jogos/eh_DocsExporter/wiki).
